# physics-ball-simulator

A physics ball simulator that uses physics to calclate the position, velocity and soon other stuff too of the balls - going to learn and implement a lot of math formulae

TO ADD NEXT:
- potetntially add friction
- prevent bug where ball sticks to top of the window and only moves in a horizontal fashion
