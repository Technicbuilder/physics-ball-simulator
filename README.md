# physics-ball-simulator

A physics ball simulator that uses physics to calclate the position, velocity and soon other stuff too of the balls, going to implement a lot of math formulas

TO ADD FOR TOMMOROW
fix gravity 
make balls lose x velocity after moving a lot
- potetntially add friction
- introduce collisions with other balls
